# Milestone 6

## Introduction
The Emvents application will have two types of users or personas: attendees (people signing up to events) and organizers (people organizing events). We will differentiate the two different roles and implement some authorization rules.

## Requirements

1. Only the user who has created the event should be able to update or delete an event. 

2. You should implement an endpoint that returns all the events organized (created) by a given user.

3. You should implement an endpoint that allows a user to sign up to (RSVP) an event.

4. You should implement an endpoint that returns all the upcoming events a user has signed up for.

5. You should implement an endpoint that allows the organizer of an event to see all the users who signed up to a given event he is organizing.
