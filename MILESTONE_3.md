# Milestone 3

## Introduction
Since we are building this project for a "real" client, we want to make sure we are shipping a high-quality product. In this milestone use testing to make sure the API works properly, even after a big refactoring (coming in milestone 4).

## Requirements

1. Your package.json should be configured to run the tests from `npm run test`

2. Add mocha, chai and chai-http to your package.json as development dependencies

3. You should implement a test for the endpoint that returns all the events
   - Use chai-http to start and make requests to your server

4. You should implement a test for the endpoint that creates an event

5. You should implement a test for the endpoint that returns one event by its id

6. You should implement a test for the endpoint that updates an existing event

7. You should implement a test for the endpoint that deletes an existing event
